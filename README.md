Repository Description:

This GitHub repository focuses on quantifying the prediction uncertainties of 10 machine learning algorithms. The provided Python code offers a comprehensive set of functionalities to enhance the user's experience in the data analysis and modeling process. The key features include:

1. **Interactive Data Visualization:**
   Easily visualize and understand each variable in the dataset through a detailed, informative, and interactive report.

2. **Feature Relationship Analysis:**
   Evaluate the linear and nonlinear relationships of each feature with the target variable (e.g., ROP) using F-Regression and Mutual-Info Regression scores. Feature importance graphs based on various algorithms are also available.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   Enable users to select features to be dropped, focusing on eliminating the least important features before applying machine learning techniques.

4. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Choose from 10 different outlier removal techniques.
   - Adjust the contamination percent (5% to 25%) to customize the outlier removal process.
   - Select from 10 scaling options for data normalization.
   - Utilize dimensionality reduction with options for kernel trick and user-defined components to be retained.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   Optional selection of a search algorithm to tune hyperparameters, providing flexibility to users based on available computational resources.

This repository is designed to empower users in their data analysis and machine learning endeavors, offering a versatile toolkit to explore, preprocess, and optimize models while providing insights into prediction uncertainties.
